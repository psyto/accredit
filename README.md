# Accredit

Shared KYC/AML compliance infrastructure for Solana. Accredit provides on-chain transfer enforcement and compliant DEX routing as reusable building blocks for regulated token applications.

## Overview

Accredit is organized into two layers:

**Core Layer** — KYC verification and transfer enforcement via Token-2022 transfer hooks. Every token transfer is validated against an on-chain whitelist that tracks KYC level, jurisdiction, expiry, and daily volume limits.

**Routing Layer** — Compliance-aware DEX aggregation built on top of Jupiter. Routes are filtered to only pass through audited, whitelisted liquidity pools. Includes optional zero-knowledge proof support for privacy-preserving compliance.

## Programs

### Transfer Hook (`5DLH2UrDD5bJFadn1gV1rof6sJ7MzJbVNnUfVMtGJgSL`)

Token-2022 transfer hook that validates every token transfer against KYC/AML requirements:

- Wallet whitelist with KYC level, jurisdiction, and expiry
- Per-wallet daily volume tracking and limits
- Per-KYC-level transaction size limits
- Jurisdiction restrictions (USA blocked by default)
- Emergency pause/resume for the registry
- Authority transfer

See [docs/programs/transfer-hook.md](docs/programs/transfer-hook.md) for full reference.

### Compliant Registry (`66tKcQqpv8GH2igWWBcLVrTjvo8cgpVJJAE8xadAgnYA`)

On-chain registry of audited DEX pools for compliant route verification:

- Pool registration with audit hash, jurisdiction, and KYC requirements
- Pool lifecycle management (Active / Suspended / Revoked)
- Batch route verification (validate all hops in a single instruction)
- Compliance config linking pool registry to KYC registry

See [docs/programs/compliant-registry.md](docs/programs/compliant-registry.md) for full reference.

# Install TypeScript dependencies
pnpm install

# Build Anchor programs
anchor build

# Build TypeScript packages
